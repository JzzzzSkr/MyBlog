## Overview

This website is designed as an introduction to the world of Miyazaki's cartoons. It aims to provide an engaging user experience while featuring:

- **React Router**: For seamless navigation across pages.
- **ReactDOM**: To render React components effectively.
- **CSS Grid and Flexbox**: For a flexible and well-structured layout.
- **Media Queries**: Ensuring responsiveness for various screen sizes.
- **Bootstrap**: To enhance design consistency and speed up development.

The application is fully responsive, offering a seamless viewing experience across different devices.

## Conclusion

Building this website not only provided insights into Miyazaki's magical world but also enhanced my skills in React and SCSS. The project challenged me to think critically about design and interactivity while utilizing modern web development tools.

I hope this project inspires others to dive into React and SCSS to create their own amazing web applications!
