# Welcome to My Blog

Hello! My name is Michael Liang, and this is my personal blog where I share my experiences in technology, programming, and life !

## This Blog's History

- 2024.12
  - Built a blog to document the projects I had worked on.
  - Chose **Hexo** + **Next** as the framework.

# About Me

In 2024, I graduated from the University of Tasmania with a major in Artificial Intelligence. I am passionate about coding and always eager to learn new technologies. If you are someone who also loves coding and wants to make a positive impact on the world with your talent, don't hesitate to say hi! I believe we can become great friends and collaborators.
